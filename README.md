# ðŸŽ² Dice Game

A simple dice game project built while learning web development.

## ðŸ†• Improvement i made
Unlike in the original course version (which rolls dice on page refresh), my version has a **Start button** when you click it, the dice roll using `addEventListener`. 
That makes the game feel more interactive and lets me practice handling events.

## ðŸš€ How to Play
1. Click the **ðŸŽ² Let's Roll!** button.
2. Two dice roll on the screen.
3. The player with the higher number wins.
4. If both numbers are equal â†’ it's a draw!
